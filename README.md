# CodeAlpha_Tasks 
This repository showcases my internship projects, where I've applied my programming skills to solve real-world problems. Each project includes a detailed description, code, and documentation.


**Description:**

This repo contains 3 projects:

1. **Hangman Game:** A classic word-guessing game implemented using Python.
2. **PDF Text-to-Speech:** Converts text extracted from PDF files into audio using `pyttsx3`.

**Installation:**

1. **Install Python:** Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed.
2. **Install required libraries:** Use pip to install the necessary libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pyttsx3 PyPDF2
   ```

**Usage:**

1. **Hangman Game:**
   - Run the `# Hangman in Python.py` script.
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game.

2. **PDF Text-to-Speech:**
   - Run the `Autmation with python (converting PDF to audiobook).py` script.
   - Provide the path to your PDF file as input.
   - The script will extract text from the PDF and convert it to audio.

**Customization:**

- **Hangman:** Adjust game parameters like word lists, maximum attempts, or difficulty levels.
- **PDF Text-to-Speech:** Customize audio settings (speed, volume, voice) and output file format.

**Contributing:**

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.



**Additional Notes:**

- Ensure you have the `pyttsx3` and `PyPDF2` libraries installed for both scripts.
- Customize the file paths and settings in the scripts to match your specific requirements.
- Consider adding more features or improvements to both the Hangman game and the PDF-to-audio functionality.

**Enjoy playing Hangman and listening to your PDFs!**
